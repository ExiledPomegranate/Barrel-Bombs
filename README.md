Your New Favorite Mining Tool: The Barrel Bomb!

Inspired by [u/-C-7007's idea from r/MinecraftSuggestions](https://www.reddit.com/r/minecraftsuggestions/comments/1kmrqhx/explosive_barrel_a_better_explosive_for_tunnels/)

Requires the [Architectury API](https://modrinth.com/mod/architectury-api)

## **‚ö†Ô∏è The Big Tradeoff**
Worried the Barrel Bomb might be overpowered? Fear not - it comes with a serious drawback: \
it drops very few items (Configurable).
It will never drop stone or ancient debris (Configurable)

## **üí• Key Features**

![Crafting Recipe. 4 blaze powder in the corners, 4 gunpowder along the edges, barrel in the center.](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cached_images/61aabcd392f7c698eb517eb570534863944bf6b9.png)

**Consistent Explosions**: More reliable than TNT, and it laughs in the face of gravity.

**Blast Resistance? Denied.** Ignores most blast resistance, making it perfect for tough biomes, such as Basalt Deltas. (Configurable)

**Directional Blasts**: The explosion extends forward based on the direction the barrel is facing. Even chain reactions preserve each individual bomb‚Äôs direction.

**Customizable Power**:

Add Blaze Powder to extend the forward range of the explosion

Add Gunpowder to increase the blast radius

Max of 32 additives per barrel (also configurable)

**Smart Placement**:

Faces away from you when placed

Hold Shift to make it face toward you instead

**Efficient Additive Use**:

Additives can be inserted one at a time with right-click

Or put the item in your offhand to use an entire stack instantly

**üõ°Ô∏è Anti-Griefing Measures**:

Deals less damage to players than TNT

Obsidian and other "player" blocks (Such as chests or beds) are immune by default (fully configurable)

**‚öôÔ∏è In-Game Configuration**:

Use the /barrelbombs command to adjust settings on the fly. Tune it to your world‚Äôs needs with ease. Note: A few settings can only be changes in the config
